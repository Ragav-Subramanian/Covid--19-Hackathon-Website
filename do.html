1. Do wash your hands before you wear your mask. 
<br><br>
2. Do cover your cough or sneeze. The best way to cough or sneeze is into your elbow and not your hands.
<br><br>
3. Do work from home. Do leave your home only for essential reasons, such as buying food or medications. 
<br><br>
4. Do cancel elective dental, medical, recreational and non-essential appointments as these can interfere with social distancing.
<br><br>
5. Do move away from others who cough or sneeze.
<br><br>
6. Do wipe down all surfaces you come into contact with. Any regular bleach-containing household products is likely to be effective.
<br><br>

7. Do call ahead to the doctor/emergency room before you head there if you think you may have symptoms concerning for COVID-19. You should also wear a facemask to protect others.
<br><br>
8. Do wear a face mask and gloves if you are caring for a family someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
<br><br>
9. Do be mindful of what you surfaces you are touching and how frequently you are touching your face.
<br><br>
10. Do protect your immune system by getting your vaccinations, eating a balanced diet, avoiding too much alcohol.
<br><br>
11. Do participate in “social distancing” to blunt the spread of the virus.
<br><br>
12. Do remember that virus may live on surfaces like cash or credit cards. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling cash or credit cards before touching your face.
<br><br>

13. Do stay home and take Tylenol, cough syrup and plenty of rest if you think you may have COVID-19.
<br><br>
14. You should also isolate yourself from your other family members, and use a designated bathroom in the house that no one else is using. 
<br><br>
15. Do look for red flags, like shortness of breath, fever >102F and worsening symptoms.
<br><br>
16. Do seek medical care if you develop any of these symptoms at any time.
<br><br>
17. Do self-quarantine yourself for 14 days if you come into contact with someone who tests positive for coronavirus.

<p style="font-family"><font color="blue" size="66px">
1. Don’t just tie a scarf around your face as that can be loose fitting and need more adjustment. Use a cloth covering that is more tight-fitting.
<br><br>
3. Don’t travel within the United States or abroad.
<br><br>
4. Don’t touch your eyes, nose, mouth or face without washing your hands.
<br><br.
5. Don’t put your shoes on surfaces you may touch. We know that the coronavirus can sustain itself on surfaces, but don’t yet know how long.
<br><br>
6. Don’t interact with your pets if you think you may have symptoms concerning for COVID-19.
<br><br>
7. Don’t treat “social distancing” like a “vacation”. This is not the time to run errands or go to the mountains. 
<br><br>
8. Don’t plan “play dates” for your kids if they are not in school.
<br><br>
10. Don’t shake hands or give hugs as greetings.
<br><br>
11. Don’t visit your older relatives or community members, as they are the highest risk group.
<br><br>
12. Don’t go to public places like gyms, theaters, restaurants.
<br><br>
13. Don’t call for testing if you don’t have symptoms as testing is not recommended by CDC and the White House Task Force if you don’t have symptoms.
